        Dalal street is a virtual stock exchange game, where the companies sell their stocks to the public at a price
        \nwhich depends on the company market value and performance.
        \nThe public then buy or sell the stocks among them for price based on the market events are stock transactions.
        \nAt the end of the game, the player who makes the most money through the stock exchange wins.
        \nThe following is a guide explaining the structure of the game and what each feature of the game means.

        \n\n<b>Home</b>
        \nThe basic details of all the companies like the company\'s stock price and the status
        \n( whether the company is gaining or losing value in the stock market )
        \nare shown in the home tab.

        \n\n<b>Stock exchange</b>
        \nThis is where you play the actual game.
        \nYou can buy stock or sell stock from other players in the stock exchange.
        \nWhen buying, you can ask for a particular number of stocks at a particular price.
        \nIf someone is willing to sell their stocks at your asked price (or lower),
        \na transaction is made and you get the stocks. An equivalent amount will be deducted from your
        \nmonetary wealth.
        \n Here, there is another feature, called the stoploss order.
        \nIf you provide a stoploss order, the transaction is made even if someone sells the stock for a price
        \nhigher than your asked price, provided that the margin of difference does
        \nnot exceed a particular amount.
        \n\nWhen selling your stocks, you can sell the stocks you already own for a price
        \ncalled the bid price.
        \nSimilarly, a match is made if someone is willing to buy those stocks at a price
        \ngreater then, or equal to the bid price.
        \nThe stoploss order has a similar kind of function in bidding too.

        \n\n<b>Bank Mortgage</b>
        \nBank Mortgage can be used to mortgage stocks with the bank at <b>75%(may vary during the course of time)</b>
        \nof the present price of the mortgaged stocks and later the mortgaged stocks
        \ncan be bought back from the bank at the stocks current price.

        \n\n<b>Transactions</b>
        \nThis tab shows all the successful and ongoing transactions that you made.
        \nIf a transaction is not successful, it means that you bid too high, or you ask too low.

        \n\n<b>Portfolio</b>
        \nThis Tab shows your profile information, including the number of stocks you have
        \nfrom every company, the wealth you have as money, and the total wealth you own
        \n through stocks.

        \n\n<b>News</b>
        \nThis tab shows all the market events belonging to different companies. This will
        \nhelp you in determining each company\'s performance, and inturn, give you an idea
        \nof what stocks to buy\sell.
        \n Please note that these events are purely fictional and are nowhere related to the
        \nreal marker conditions

        \n\n<b>Performance</b>
        \nThis tab contains graphs drawn using the past performance of a given company.

        \n\n<b>Market depth</b>
        \nMarket depth tells us the different price range for which people have
        \nasked and bid stocks belonging to a particular company.
        \nIt contains two histograms for a given company, one for bids and one for asks.

        \nHave a great Pragyan!
